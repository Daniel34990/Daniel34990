# 👋 Who Am I?

Hi, I’m **@Daniel34990** (Daniel Akbarinia), a Digital Engineering student at **Télécom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris)**.

🎯 I’m passionate about **image processing**, **computer vision**, and **artificial intelligence** — especially applying **deep learning** and **machine learning** to solve real-world challenges in **medical imaging** and data analysis.

🌱 Currently deepening my knowledge in:
- Advanced image **segmentation**, **classification**, and **object detection**
- AI-driven techniques for understanding and interpreting complex visual data

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on research projects related to:
- **Data science**
- **AI**
- **Medical imaging**

📫 Reach me at: **daniel.akbarinia@telecom-paris.fr**

😄 Pronouns: He/Him  
⚡ Fun fact: I’m fascinated by how AI can replicate aspects of human perception — and how those capabilities can be harnessed for instance to improve **diagnostic accuracy and automation** in **medical imaging**.
